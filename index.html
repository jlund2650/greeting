                        I am a fourth year DMC major at The University of Cincinnati. <br> 
                        I'm originally from Canton, Ohio but moved to Cincinnati independently <br> 
                        right after graduating high school. I am a graphic and live visual designer<br>
                        for an event coordination company here in the city. I also love to DJ in my <br>
                        spare time as well as enjoy the outdoors hiking or playing soccer. My development <br>
                        experience is very minimal other than one course on HTML5 and CSS. My current <br>
                        favorite games to play are Overwatch and Apex Legends.
